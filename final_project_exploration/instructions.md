CISC 3225: Final Project
100 Points
Due May 15, 2024 at 11:59 PM

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to produce a portfolio-quality analysis of a dataset using techniques from
class. Aside from a few fundamental requirements shown below, you have significant latitude to ask
whatever questions you feel are appropriate about your data, and to answer them using any technique
you want.


#### 1. Dataset
Identify a dataset of suitable complexity for an in-depth analysis. Your dataset should have
approximately the following characteristics, with some room for variation depending on interest,
available data, and your plans for the project:


- At least six major variables, including:
- 3 or more continuous variables (price, population, age, dimensions, rating, etc.)
- 3 or more categorical variables (species, product type, political party, home state, etc.)

Ideally, you should have some domain knowledge about the dataset. If not, you can familiarize

yourself with the domain where necessary to explain any observations or insights.
Dataset sources:
• Kaggle
• Datasets for Data Cleaning Practice
• Social Security data
• NYC OpenData
• UCI Machine Learning Repository

#### 2. Exploratory Analysis

Conduct an exploratory analysis of the data. The analysis should include:

• If your dataset has missing values, identify and explain them. If your analysis requires you to
handle the missing values, describe your strategy for doing so.
• Numeric variables:
◦ Mean, min, max, median, quartiles
◦ Correlations between all variables
◦ Visualize outliers
◦ Visualize data distribution
• Categorical variables: Value counts with bar charts
3. High-level analysis
Perform at least 6 higher-level analyses of your data. You are free to use any techniques we discussed
in class, including but not limited to:
• Use Pandas features to answer specific questions about the data
• Perform a cluster analysis to identify groups within your data
• Identify and motivate a machine learning problem in your data (classification or regression).
Create a train/test/validation split and evaluate how well an appropriate model performs
• Perform a linear regression to show the relationship between two variables
If applicable to an analysis, you must include:
• Appropriate statistical test(s)
• An appropriate visualization.
Please take advantage of the check-ins or office hours if you are unsure whether a visualization or
statistical test is necessary for an analysis.
4. Final Report
Compile your results into a written report submitted separately as a PDF, Word document, or other
appropriate text format. Do not include code in the report unless absolutely necessary. Your report
should use the following structure:
1. Introduction: Describe your dataset. What is its purpose and what kind of data does it contain?
What do you hope to discover in your analysis?
2. Exploratory analysis. Describe the characteristics of the data you observe, with visualization to
support your observations. Use domain knowledge to explain interesting observations, citing
external sources if necessary.
3. High-level analysis. Introduce each of your analyses and present them, with relevant
visualizations, in their own sections.
4. Conclusions. What did you learn from this project? End with a thoughtful discussion of the data
and insights you obtained from your analysis, and draw conclusions.
Check-ins
Two project check-ins will be conducted before the end of the semester and are intended to give you
feedback on work you have completed so far. Each check-in is worth 5 points. More details will be
posted on Blackboard.
Submission
Submit your work before 11:59 on the deadline. Late submissions will not be accepted. Your
submission must include your written report in a suitable format (PDF, Word, LibreOffice, etc.) and all
notebooks (in .ipynb format) used to produce results used in the paper. All code must be executable:
do not include code in your written report.
